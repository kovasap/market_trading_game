# A Resource Management Board game

See `design.md` for rules/description.

## Development

While Tabletop Simulator game is running, in Atom, run "Get Lua Scripts" with
the Tabletop Simulator plugin to get script for TTS save file.  Then replace
those scripts with the ones in the tts-lua directory in this repo.  Then run
"Save & Play" to upload version controlled scripts to the game.
